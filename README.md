# Stadiums Data Pipeline

The project involves developing an **Airflow** ETL pipeline to process data for football stadiums worldwide:

* Extract stadiums data from the [List of Association Football Stadiums by Capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_association_football_stadiums_by_capacity#Football_stadiums_by_capacity)
 webpage.
* Clean and transform data using **Pyspark**.
* Load data into a **BigQuery** table.
* Run data analysis queries to gain insights on stadiums capacities across different locations.
